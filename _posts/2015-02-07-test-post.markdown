I'm writing this first post to see how to do it.

Let's test some features.

Let's see what R code looks like:
{% highlight R %}
print('Hello world!')
{% endhighlight %}

Let's see if we can link to scripts in the test repo:
Click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BES-QSIG/test/master/css/main.scss) to see the main.scss.

So those two aspects work. The next step will be to find a template that will make the site less of a blog and more of a wiki.

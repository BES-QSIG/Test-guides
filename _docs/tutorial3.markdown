Let's try a different code highlighting syntax.

```{R}
# LIBRARY
library(ape)

# PROCESS
tree <- read.tree('example.tre')
plot(tree)

for (i in 1:length(100)) {
    print ('this')
}
```


Well ^^ that doesn't work. Mustn't be compatible for kramdown. We should really research what markdown best sutis are needs.


I want to make a change to this tutorial, I'm writing these lines.

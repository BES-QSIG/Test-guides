# Welcome!

Hello and welcome to _Computational Guides for Ecologists_!

The idea of this website is to provide a platform of open-source documents
that provide useful information on all things computational for ecologists.

We're hoping to write documents that will cover increasingly essential computer
skills for the ecological researcher, such as:

* Introduction to version control with Git
* How to use GitHub (and why it's good!)
* A-Z of creating a package in R, python or whatever....
* Good coding practices (and philosphy!)
* Good coding styles
* Reviews of text-editors
* How to build reproducible scientific pipelines for publication
* How-tos on the latest R packages (such as dplyr)

.... and much more!

Although we (i.e. the British Ecological Society Quantitative Ecology
Specialist Interest Group) will be writing many of these documents and making
them available via this website, we want to open it out to the ecological
community .... which is why we've come up with this simple platform for hosting
open-source documents.

Anyone will be able to download the open-source documents, written in Markdown,
and edit the pre-existing documents or add their own. These changes can then be
pushed to the website!

At the moment this is just the test website, hence 'test' in the URL and the
hit-and-miss design. But if you want to contribute a tutorial document on
anything computational, feel free to follow the guides listed below!

## How to contribute

In order to contribute to the website, you'll need a GitHub account, know how to
create Markdown files and have read the tutorial _how to contribute_. It may
also be helpful to have read the tutorial on the website structure.

* [How to contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/how_to_contribute)
* [How to write Markdown documents]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/introduction_to_markdown)
* [Website structure]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/website_structure)

Thanks for helping out!
